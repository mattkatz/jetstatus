<p>Jetstatus is a Twitter client for Jetpack. It polls the service for new updates and displays popup notifications for every entry in the friends timeline. It also adds a slidebar entry that displays the history of received tweets since the jetpack was launched.
<p>This way a twitter user can have faster access to his tweet stream from the cached view in the slidebar, compared to visiting the Twitter web site, while also receiving near real-time popup notifications.
